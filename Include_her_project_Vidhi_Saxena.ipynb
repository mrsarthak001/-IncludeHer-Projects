The country has emphasized the importance of both sides working towards a peaceful settlement and avoiding any unilateral actions that could hinder the peace process.\\n\\nWhile Australia recognizes Israel's legitimate security concerns, it has also expressed concerns about Israeli settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, as they are seen as an obstacle to peace. Australia has advocated for a freeze on settlement construction and the removal of existing settlements.\\n\\nAustralia has also condemned acts of violence and terrorism from both sides and has urged both Israelis and Palestinians to refrain from actions that could exacerbate tensions and hinder the peace process.\\n\\nOverall, Australia's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict in the UNSC is rooted in promoting a peaceful and negotiated solution based on the principles of a two-state solution, emphasizing the right to self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians while recognizing the security concerns of Israel.\""

The country also calls for increased transparency in decision-making processes, including procurement and project management, to prevent corruption and ensure the optimal utilization of resources.\\n\\nNorway promotes the involvement of all stakeholders, including member states, partner organizations, and beneficiaries, in the review process.
